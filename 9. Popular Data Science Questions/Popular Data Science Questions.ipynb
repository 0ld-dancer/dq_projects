    "## Introduction\n",
    "### What is this project about\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we're working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or interactive text-based platforms like [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). And as enthusiastic employees we've desided to o scour the internet in search for the answer to the question:\n",
    "* **What is it that people want to learn about in data science?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking back to our experience when we first started learning programming, it occurs to us that if we wanted to figure out what programming content to write, we could consult [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and see what kind of content is more popular. We've decided to investigate Stack Overflow a little more and found out that it is part of a question and answer website network called [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/).\n",

    "Stack Exchange hosts a huge amount of sitess on a multitude of fields and subjects, including mathematics, physics, philosophy, and data science. Just what we are looking for!\n",
    "Also we can include data engineering as our point of interest. So there are some websites relevant to our goal:\n",
    "* [Data Science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)\n",
    "* [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) (a statistics site)\n",
    "* [Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.stackexchange.com/)\n",
    "* [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/)\n",
    "* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) itself\n",
    "* [Database Administrators](https://dba.stackexchange.com/)\n",
    "* [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)\n",
    "* [Software Engineering](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A closer look to the Stack Exchange websites\n",
    "Let's take for example **Stack Overflow** and walk through it a bit just to get you familiar with it. Another sites are similar to Stack Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically **it is Q&A website** where everyone welcomes to ask about a wide range of topics in computer programming. If someone runs into a problem, doesn't know exactly how a particular function works, or is struggling to get their code to work they come here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to issues can be related to different programming languages, there is a **tagging system** that helps filter and navigate content. Also there is a **voting system** that allows to rate best questions and answers so their authors can earn reputation points.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally there is a **job finding section** where you can try to get youself a new fancy job.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question here is the main unit followed with answer and comments. It has rating, views number and tags (usually)\n",

    "\n",
    "Stack Exchange provides a public data base for each of its websites. Here's a link to query and explore [Data Science Stack Exchange's database](https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/new). It uses a Transact-SQL to write queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "## First steps\n",
    "### Stack Exchange Data Explorer\n",
    "Stack Exchange Data Explorer or just SEDE is a great instrument so why wouldn't we use it. We can run a query right there and just download a CSV file that we'll be able to use further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the posts table. We'll be focusing our attention on those that seem relevant towards our goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Id**: An identification number for the post.\n",
    "* **PostTypeId**: An identification number for the type of post.\n",
    "* **CreationDate**: The date and time of creation of the post.\n",
    "* **Score**: The post's score.\n",
    "* **ViewCount**: How many times the post was viewed.\n",
    "* **Tags**: What tags were used.\n",
    "* **AnswerCount**: How many answers the question got.\n",
    "* **FavoriteCount**: How many times the question was favored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we will limit ourselves questions asked in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get that info from the SEDE we'll run the folllowing query:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT p.Id, pt.Name AS PostType, p.CreationDate, p.Score,\n",
    "       p.ViewCount, p.Tags, p.AnswerCount, p.FavoriteCount\n",
    "  FROM posts AS p\n",
    "       LEFT JOIN PostTypes AS pt\n",
    "       ON p.PostTypeId = pt.Id\n",
    " WHERE YEAR(CreationDate) = 2019;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we'll just download related CSV and read it to the dataframe."

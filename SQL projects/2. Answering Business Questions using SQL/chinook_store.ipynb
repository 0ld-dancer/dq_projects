    "**Protected MPEG-4 video** files are poorly sold. Only **1.4%** of tracks were sold. Actually these files are not tracks at all but video. Probably it should be removed from the store.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We've found most popular genres in the USA and made some recomendstions for the Chinook store:\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. We've found best sales agent. It's **Jane Peacock** with:\n",
    "    * number of customes - **21**\n",
    "    * average single sale - **8.17**\n",
    "    * average sales per customer - **82.45**\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. We've analysed country sales and found following:\n",
    "    * Chinook gained from sales in the USA about **1040** dollars - **22%** of all profit. It's comparable with profit gained from **15** different countries that bring **1095** dollars - **23%**\n",
    "    * Czech Republic customers are real melomans. There are the highest average order value - **9.11** and average sales per customer - **136.62**\n",
    "    * In addition we've got values for whole **world**. Now we can easily compare sales results from any country with global results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. We've explored album and individual tracks sales. Only **18.6%** of sales are albumls. Other **81.4%** are generated by selling individual tracks.\n",

    "    \n",
    "6. We've found that only **51.6%** of tracks have been sold. To improve this result we've suggested to cut number of **Latin** tracks in half and remove tracks of 10 genres from the store at all(less then **11%** were sold):\n",

    "\n",
    "* Protected AAC audio file\n",
    "* Protected MPEG-4 video file\n",

    "Also let's remember that only **51.6%** of tracks were purchased from Chinook store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protected MPEG-4 video** files are poorly sold. Only **1.4%** of tracks were sold. Actually these files are not tracks at all but video. Probably it should be removed from the store.\n",

    "**Protected AAC audio** files have better results. **36.3%** of tracks were sold but it is still worse that average sales.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We've found most popular genres in the USA and made some recomendstions for the Chinook store:\n",
    "    * **Red Tone** - punk(and also alternative) tracks give **12.37%** of sales  \n",
    "    * **Slim Jim Bites** - blues tracks give **3.43%** of sales\n",
    "    * **Meteor and the Girls** - pop tracks give **2.09%** of sales\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. We've found best sales agent. It's **Jane Peacock** with:\n",
    "    * number of customes - **21**\n",
    "    * average single sale - **8.17**\n",
    "    * average sales per customer - **82.45**\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. We've analysed country sales and found following:\n",
    "    * Chinook gained from sales in the USA about **1040** dollars - **22%** of all profit. It's comparable with profit gained from **15** different countries that bring **1095** dollars - **23%**\n",
    "    * Czech Republic customers are real melomans. There are the highest average order value - **9.11** and average sales per customer - **136.62**\n",
    "    * In addition we've got values for whole **world**. Now we can easily compare sales results from any country with global results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. We've explored album and individual tracks sales. Only **18.6%** of sales are albumls. Other **81.4%** are generated by selling individual tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We've found most popular artists using two different criterias:\n",
    "    * **Eugene Ormandy**. His tracks appear in **7** playlists\n",
    "    * **\"Iron Maden\"**. Their tracks appear **516** times in the playlists\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. We've found that only **51.6%** of tracks have been sold. To improve this result we've suggested to cut number of **Latin** tracks in half and remove tracks of 10 genres from the store at all(less then **11%** were sold):\n",
    "    - Soundtrack\n",
    "    - TV Shows\n",
    "    - Drama\n",
    "    - Bossa Nova\n",

    "    - Opera\n",
    "    - Rock And Roll\n",
    "    - Sci Fi & Fantasy\n",
    "    - Science Fiction\n",
    "    - World\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. We've explored protected files from the Chinook store. They didn't bring more profit then unprotected ones. **Protected MPEG-4 video** files should be removed from the store at all. Only **1.4%** of them were sold."

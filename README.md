### [12. Predicting the stock market](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/tree/main/12.%20Predicting%20the%20stock%20market)

Basic script.

### [13. Predicting Bike Rentals (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/13.%20Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals/13.%20Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals.ipynb)

### [14. A Handwritten Digits Classifier (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/14.%20A%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier/digits_classifier.ipynb)

  I applied [`KNeighborsClassifier()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) and [`MLPClassifier()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html) to the built-n sklearn handwritten digits data set from [`load_digits()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html). Explored how NN works with different hyperparameters and L2 regulariation. I used manually hyperparameters iteration and [`GridSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). Finally I visualized MLP weights.

### [16. Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/16.%20Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/the_best_markets.ipynb)

 In this project I've been working in a e-learning company and looking for the best markets (countries) to advertise in. Two criterias for our searches were number of potential students and money spent on learning on average. As data set I've used [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/) results.
 
### [17. Mobile App for Lottery Addiction (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/17.%20Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction/lottery_addiction.ipynb)

 In this project I've been helping a medical institute with the app. Using combinations and probability formulas I've written functions that allow to:
* find the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket
* check whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery
* find the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816
* find the probability of having 2, 3, 4 or 5 winning numbers exactly

### [18. Spam Filter with Naive Bayes (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/18.%20Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes/spam_filter.ipynb)

 In this project I've created a simple spam filter using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The final accuracy is 98.56%.
 
 I've used the data set from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). It has 5,572 SMS messages classified by humans.

## SQL

### [1. Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/SQL%20projects/1.%20Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQL/Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQL.ipynb)

### [2. Answering Business Questions using SQL (ENG)](https://github.com/0ld-dancer/dq_projects/blob/main/SQL%20projects/2.%20Answering%20Business%20Questions%20using%20SQL/chinook_store.ipynb)

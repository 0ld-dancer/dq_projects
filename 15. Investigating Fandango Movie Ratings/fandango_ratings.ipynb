    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "In october 15, 2015 a data jourmalist Walt Hickey published his [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) about [Fandango's rating system](https://www.fandango.com/). He analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased:\n",
    "* The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star\n",
    "* In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star\n",
    "* For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars\n",
    "\n",
    "After that Fandango's officials replied that it was a bug in their system, and they promised to fix it as soon as possible. Presumably, this has already happened, but we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value isn't displayed anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's article. We'll compare the system's characteristics previous and after the analysis for that purpose. And we have ready-made data for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data Walt Hickey collected to analyze for his article\n",
    "\n",
    "* Movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Both data sets can be downloaded from this [Github repository](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First look\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's read both files and take a look in their structure."

    "Much better! Now let's recall our purpose. We must determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system or not. So population of interest for our goal - all the movies that Fandango's system has.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we'll work with two samples. To spread results to the whole population these **samples must be representative**. Fortunately to find it out we have `README.md` files that describe how samples were gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Hickey's file](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/fandango/README.md) tells us that the data set contains films that have:\n",
    "* a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a RT User rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score\n",
    "* at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango\n",

    "* released in 2016 and 2017\n",

    "It's clearly that sampling in both cases was **selective, not random**. Data was gathered specifically for analyst's purposes. Given this, it cannot be said that the samples are representative. Most likely they are not.\n",

    "#### Tweaking the goal\n",

    "At this point, we have at least two alternatives: either we collect new data, either we change the goal of our analysis by placing some limitations on it. The second one seems a much faster choice. Also, it's quasi-impossible to collect a new sample previous to Hickey's analysis at this moment in time.\n",
